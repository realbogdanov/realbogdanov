## About me:
I am a Pipeline TD developer with experience working at Russia's largest CG studio, CGF Studio, where I develop solutions for key software such as Maya, Nuke, and Houdini. 
My tools include Qt.py, FFMPEG, Pillow, and the internal libraries of these programs.

My work has improved software performance by over 3 times, significantly enhancing team workflows. 
I specialize in automating processes, creating stylish and user-friendly interfaces, and exploring AI applications to optimize CG artists' workflows.

Before entering the CG industry, I spent five years in aviation, including three years as an aircraft technician. 
This background shaped my approach: systems must be error-proof, code should be fully documented and scalable, and solutions must prioritize reliability and efficiency.

I am a team player and a creative leader, always ready to take responsibility for complex tasks. 
I enjoy sharing knowledge, brainstorming new ideas with colleagues, and implementing workflow improvements. 
I regularly study the latest technologies and industry trends through LinkedIn, Reddit, and professional events.
